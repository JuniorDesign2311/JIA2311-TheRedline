# The Redline üöó
There is currently no centralized place for vintage car enthusiasts to connect with the greater car community. Our application is an all-in-one platform that will aggregate car show events and meetups, allowing users to favorite and post their own events. 

# Release Notes version The Redline 1.0 

## NEW FEATURES 
* Location Permission Services for Users 
* Event Search Bar with Filters for Event Title, Date, and Proximity  
* Event Creation with Google Places Autocomplete, Date Picker, and Time Picker 
* Capability to Edit and Delete Events 
* Interactive Event Markers with Pop-up on Google Maps API 
* Favoriting System for Events

## BUG FIXES 
* Fixed an error where our account system would create an account but not continue to the application‚Äôs landing page due to an error with our error handling. 
* Fixed distortion of the screen size on the map screen whenever a user logged in with their phone‚Äôs keyboard still active. 
* Fixed a bug for the submit button on the event creation that required 2 presses 
* Fixed Firebase Authentication/Writing error in which it would create the account before continuing to step 2. This was an issue as users were allowed to go back to change their email address, phone number, etc. and thus not allowing them to reuse their information previously chosen. 

## KNOWN ISSUES 
*  TBD

### Issues

* Current Location Functionality
* Event Map Markers
* Split the databse "users" into "hosts" and "attendees"

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed an issue in which certain buttons pressed would result in Render Errors due to invalid objects.
* Corrected error handling from the login page that ultimately restricted user login where our database was incorrectly reading.
* Our Firebase Database wouldn't read the correct user which didn't allow for accurate data updates.
* We fixed an error where our account system would create an account but not continue due to an error with our error handling.
* Another bug we encountered and fixed dealt with the map screen sizing. Whenever a user logs in with the keyboard not
dismissed it would distort the screen size of the map screen after so we fixed this by dismissing the keyboard upon login.
* We found a bug with the form validation changing only after we move backwards to the page. We fixed this error by
redesigning our form validation logic.
* Location tracking will occasionally zoom out on an area because area tracking accuracy is set to low.

## Version 0.1.0

* Account Creation Screen
* Forgot Password Authentication

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed an issue where pressing "Continue" on account creation would proceed to the next step of account creation 
even though certain fields/parameters were incorrect.
* Fixed Firebase Authentication/Writing error in which it would create the account before continuing to step 2.
This was an issue because users are allowed to go back to change their email address, phone number, etc. and thus
not allowing them to reuse their information previously chosen.
* Fixed an error where typing in the "Confirm Password" field would automatically fill in the "Phone Number" field.
* Fixed an error where "Confirm Password" would require a strong password
